within its bounds. The <code>mouseEnabled</code> property of the
InteractiveObject instance must also be set to <code>true</code> for the
object to receive <code>doubleClick</code> events.

not receive any mouse events(or other user input events like keyboard

<p>By default, the value is <code>false</code> and focusing an
InteractiveObject instance does not raise a soft keyboard. If the

accept user input after a programmatic call to set the Stage

client system has a hardware keyboard available or does not support
virtual keyboards, then the soft keyboard is not raised.</p>

The

set for the object.
<em>
<p>If any currently displayed object in the SWF file contains a
<code>tabIndex</code> property, automatic tab ordering is disabled, and
the tab ordering is calculated from the <code>tabIndex</code> properties
of objects in the SWF file. The custom tab ordering includes only objects
that have <code>tabIndex</code> properties.</p>
</em>
<p>The <code>tabIndex</code> property can be a non-negative integer. The
objects are ordered according to their <code>tabIndex</code> properties,
in ascending order. An object with a <code>tabIndex</code> value of 1
precedes an object with a <code>tabIndex</code> value of 2. Do not use the
same <code>tabIndex</code> value for multiple objects.</p>
<em>
<p>The custom tab ordering that the <code>tabIndex</code> property defines
is <i>flat</i>. This means that no attention is paid to the hierarchical
relationships of objects in the SWF file. All objects in the SWF file with
<code>tabIndex</code> properties are placed in the tab order, and the tab
order is determined by the order of the <code>tabIndex</code> values. </p>
</em>
<p><b>Note:</b> To set the tab order for TLFTextField instances, cast the
display object child of the TLFTextField as an InteractiveObject, then set
the <code>tabIndex</code> property. For example: &lt;pre

reverse the tab order from the default setting for three instances of a
TLFTextField object(<code>tlfInstance1</code>, <code>tlfInstance2</code>
