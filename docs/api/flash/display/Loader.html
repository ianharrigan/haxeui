<em>
</em> <p>The Loader class overrides the following methods that it inherits,

<em> exception: <code>addChild()</code>, <code>addChildAt()</code>,
</em> <code>removeChild()</code>, <code>removeChildAt()</code>, and
<em> <code>setChildIndex()</code>. To remove a loaded display object, you must
</em> remove the <i>Loader</i> object from its parent DisplayObjectContainer
<em> child array. </p>
</em>
<em> <p><b>Note:</b> The ActionScript 2.0 MovieClipLoader and LoadVars classes
</em> are not used in ActionScript 3.0. The Loader and URLLoader classes replace
<em> them.</p>
</em>
<em> <p>When you use the Loader class, consider the Flash Player and Adobe AIR
</em> security model: </p>
<em>
</em> <ul>
<em>   <li>You can load content from any accessible source. </li>
</em>   <li>Loading is not allowed if the calling SWF file is in a network
<em> sandbox and the file to be loaded is local. </li>
</em>   <li>If the loaded content is a SWF file written with ActionScript 3.0, it
<em> cannot be cross-scripted by a SWF file in another security sandbox unless
</em> that cross-scripting arrangement was approved through a call to the
<em> <code>System.allowDomain()</code> or the
</em> <code>System.allowInsecureDomain()</code> method in the loaded content
<em> file.</li>
</em>   <li>If the loaded content is an AVM1 SWF file(written using ActionScript
<em> 1.0 or 2.0), it cannot be cross-scripted by an AVM2 SWF file(written using
</em> ActionScript 3.0). However, you can communicate between the two SWF files
<em> by using the LocalConnection class.</li>
</em>   <li>If the loaded content is an image, its data cannot be accessed by a
<em> SWF file outside of the security sandbox, unless the domain of that SWF

<em> image.</li>
</em>   <li>Movie clips in the local-with-file-system sandbox cannot script movie
<em> clips in the local-with-networking sandbox, and the reverse is also

<em>   <li>You cannot connect to commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of
</em> blocked ports, see "Restricting Networking APIs" in the <i>ActionScript 3.0
<em> Developer's Guide</i>. </li>

<em>
</em> <p>When loading a SWF file from an untrusted source(such as a domain other
<em> than that of the Loader object's root SWF file), you may want to define a
</em> mask for the Loader object, to prevent the loaded content(which is a child
<em> of the Loader object) from drawing to portions of the Stage outside of that
</em> mask, as shown in the following code:</p></p></div><h2>Instance Fields</h2><div class="platform platform-haxeui-ui-toolkit"><a name="content"></a><h3><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <a href="#content"><span class="identifier">content</span></a>:<a class="type" href="/haxeui/docs/api/flash/display/DisplayObject.html">DisplayObject</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Contains the root display object of the SWF file or image(JPG, PNG, or
GIF) file that was loaded by using the <code>load()</code> or
<code>loadBytes()</code> methods.</p>
<p>@throws SecurityError The loaded SWF file or image file belongs to a
security sandbox to which you do not have access.
For a loaded SWF file, you can avoid this situation
by having the file call the
<code>Security.allowDomain()</code> method or by
having the loading file specify a
<code>loaderContext</code> parameter with its
<code>securityDomain</code> property set to
<code>SecurityDomain.currentDomain</code> when you
call the <code>load()</code> or
<code>loadBytes()</code> method.</p></div></div><div class="platform platform-haxeui-ui-toolkit"><a name="contentLoaderInfo"></a><h3><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <a href="#contentLoaderInfo"><span class="identifier">contentLoaderInfo</span></a>:<a class="type" href="/haxeui/docs/api/flash/display/LoaderInfo.html">LoaderInfo</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Returns a LoaderInfo object corresponding to the object being loaded.
LoaderInfo objects are shared between the Loader object and the loaded
content object. The LoaderInfo object supplies loading progress
information and statistics about the loaded file.
<em>
<p>Events related to the load are dispatched by the LoaderInfo object
referenced by the <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the Loader
object. The <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property is set to a valid
LoaderInfo object, even before the content is loaded, so that you can add
event listeners to the object prior to the load.</p>
</em>
<p>To detect uncaught errors that happen in a loaded SWF, use the
<code>Loader.uncaughtErrorEvents</code> property, not the
<code>Loader.contentLoaderInfo.uncaughtErrorEvents</code> property.</p></p></div></div><div class="platform platform-haxeui-ui-toolkit"><a name="uncaughtErrorEvents"></a><h3><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <a href="#uncaughtErrorEvents"><span class="identifier">uncaughtErrorEvents</span></a>:<a class="type" href="/haxeui/docs/api/flash/events/UncaughtErrorEvents.html">UncaughtErrorEvents</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>An object that dispatches an <code>uncaughtError</code> event when an

uncaught error happens when an error is thrown outside of any

with no registered listeners.
<em>
<p>Note that a Loader object's <code>uncaughtErrorEvents</code> property
dispatches events that bubble through it, not events that it dispatches
directly. It never dispatches an <code>uncaughtErrorEvent</code> in the
target phase. It only dispatches the event in the capture and bubbling
phases. To detect an uncaught error in the current SWF(the SWF in which
the Loader object is defined) use the
<code>LoaderInfo.uncaughtErrorEvents</code> property instead.</p>
</em>
<p>If the content loaded by the Loader object is an AVM1(ActionScript 2)
SWF file, uncaught errors in the AVM1 SWF file do not result in an
<code>uncaughtError</code> event.</p></p></div></div><div class="platform platform-haxeui-ui-toolkit"><a name="new"></a><h3><code><span class="keyword">function</span> <a href="#new"><span class="identifier">new</span></a>():<a class="type" href="/haxeui/docs/api/Void.html">Void</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Creates a Loader object that you can use to load files, such as SWF, JPEG,

as a child of the Loader instance. You can then add the Loader object to
the display list(for instance, by using the <code>addChild()</code>
method of a DisplayObjectContainer instance). The asset appears on the
Stage as it loads.
<em>
<p>You can also use a Loader instance "offlist," that is without adding it
to a display object container on the display list. In this mode, the
Loader instance might be used to load a SWF file that contains additional
modules of an application. </p>
</em>
<p>To detect when the SWF file is finished loading, you can use the events
of the LoaderInfo object associated with the
<code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the Loader object. At that
point, the code in the module SWF file can be executed to initialize and
start the module. In the offlist mode, a Loader instance might also be
used to load a SWF file that contains components or media assets. Again,
you can use the LoaderInfo object event notifications to detect when the
components are finished loading. At that point, the application can start
using the components and media assets in the library of the SWF file by
instantiating the ActionScript 3.0 classes that represent those components
and assets.</p>
<em>
<p>To determine the status of a Loader object, monitor the following
events that the LoaderInfo object associated with the
<code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the Loader object:</p>
</em>
<ul>
<li>The <code>open</code> event is dispatched when loading begins.</li>
<li>The <code>ioError</code> or <code>securityError</code> event is
dispatched if the file cannot be loaded or if an error occured during the
load process. </li>
<li>The <code>progress</code> event fires continuously while the file is
being loaded.</li>
<li>The <code>complete</code> event is dispatched when a file completes
downloading, but before the loaded movie clip's methods and properties are
available. </li>
<li>The <code>init</code> event is dispatched after the properties and
methods of the loaded SWF file are accessible, so you can begin
manipulating the loaded SWF file. This event is dispatched before the
<code>complete</code> handler. In streaming SWF files, the
<code>init</code> event can occur significantly earlier than the
<code>complete</code> event. For most purposes, use the <code>init</code>
handler.</li>

<p>A SWF file or image loaded into a Loader object inherits the position,
rotation, and scale properties of the parent display objects of the Loader
object. </p>
<em>
<p>Use the <code>unload()</code> method to remove movies or images loaded

</em>
<p>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the
<code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and
<code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF
content.</p>
<em>
<p>When you use this method, consider the Flash Player security model,
which is described in the Loader class description. </p>
</em>
<p> In Flash Player 10 and later, if you use a multipart Content-Type(for
example "multipart/form-data") that contains an upload(indicated by a
"filename" parameter in a "content-disposition" header within the POST
body), the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to
uploads:</p>
<em>
<ul>
<li>The POST operation must be performed in response to a user-initiated
action, such as a mouse click or key press.</li>
<li>If the POST operation is cross-domain(the POST target is not on the
same server as the SWF file that is sending the POST request), the target
server must provide a URL policy file that permits cross-domain
access.</li>
</ul>
</em>
<p>Also, for any multipart Content-Type, the syntax must be valid
(according to the RFC2046 standard). If the syntax appears to be invalid,
the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to
uploads.</p>

commands from loaded SWF files. This method attempts to unload SWF files
that were loaded using <code>Loader.load()</code> or
<code>Loader.loadBytes()</code> by removing references to EventDispatcher,
NetConnection, Timer, Sound, or Video objects of the child SWF file. As a
result, the following occurs for the child SWF file and the child SWF
file's display list:
<ul>
<li>Sounds are stopped.</li>
<li>Stage event listeners are removed.</li>
<li>Event listeners for <code>enterFrame</code>,
<code>frameConstructed</code>, <code>exitFrame</code>,
<code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code> are removed.</li>
<li>Timers are stopped.</li>
<li>Camera and Microphone instances are detached</li>
<li>Movie clips are stopped.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>@param gc Provides a hint to the garbage collector to run on the child SWF
objects(<code>true</code>) or not(<code>false</code>). If you
are unloading many objects asynchronously, setting the
<code>gc</code> paramter to <code>false</code> might improve
application performance. However, if the parameter is set to
<code>false</code>, media and display objects of the child SWF
file might persist in memory after running the
<code>unloadAndStop()</code> command.</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
