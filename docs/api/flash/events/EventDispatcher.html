<em> events. The EventDispatcher class implements the IEventDispatcher interface
</em> and is the base class for the DisplayObject class. The EventDispatcher
<em> class allows any object on the display list to be an event target and as
</em> such, to use the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.
<em>
</em> <p>Event targets are an important part of the Flash<sup>®</sup> Player and
<em> Adobe<sup>®</sup> AIR<sup>®</sup> event model. The event target serves as
</em> the focal point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy.
<em> When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs, Flash Player or
</em> the AIR application dispatches an event object into the event flow from the
<em> root of the display list. The event object then makes its way through the
</em> display list until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins
<em> its return trip through the display list. This round-trip journey to the
</em> event target is conceptually divided into three phases: the capture phase
<em> comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event
</em> target's node, the target phase comprises only the event target node, and
<em> the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the return
</em> trip to the root of the display list.</p>
<em>
</em> <p>In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event
<em> dispatching capabilities is to extend EventDispatcher. If this is
</em> impossible(that is, if the class is already extending another class), you
<em> can instead implement the IEventDispatcher interface, create an
</em> EventDispatcher member, and write simple hooks to route calls into the
<em> aggregated EventDispatcher.</p>

the listener receives notification of an event. You can register event
listeners on all nodes in the display list for a specific type of event,
phase, and priority.
<em>
<p>After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change
its priority through additional calls to <code>addEventListener()</code>.
To change a listener's priority, you must first call
<code>removeListener()</code>. Then you can register the listener again
with the new priority level. </p>
</em>
<p>Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to
<code>addEventListener()</code> with a different <code>type</code> or
<code>useCapture</code> value result in the creation of a separate
listener registration. For example, if you first register a listener with
<code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>, it listens only during
the capture phase. If you call <code>addEventListener()</code> again using
the same listener object, but with <code>useCapture</code> set to
<code>false</code>, you have two separate listeners: one that listens
during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and
bubbling phases. </p>
<em>
<p>You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the
bubbling phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because
bubbling applies only to the ancestors of the target node.</p>
</em>
<p>If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling
<code>removeEventListener()</code>, or memory problems could result. Event
listeners are not automatically removed from memory because the garbage
collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object
exists(unless the <code>useWeakReference</code> parameter is set to
<code>true</code>).</p>
<em>
<p>Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners
attached to it.(If your newly created node needs an event listener, you
must attach the listener after creating the node.) However, if you move an
EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners attached to it move along
with it.</p>
</em>
<p>If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is
being processed on this node, the event listener is not triggered during
the current phase but can be triggered during a later phase in the event
flow, such as the bubbling phase.</p>
*
<p>If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being
processed on the node, it is still triggered by the current actions. After
it is removed, the event listener is never invoked again(unless
registered again for future processing). </p></p>
<p>@param type             The type of event.
@param useCapture       Determines whether the listener works in the
capture phase or the target and bubbling phases.
If <code>useCapture</code> is set to
<code>true</code>, the listener processes the
event only during the capture phase and not in the
target or bubbling phase. If
<code>useCapture</code> is <code>false</code>, the
listener processes the event only during the
target or bubbling phase. To listen for the event
in all three phases, call
<code>addEventListener</code> twice, once with
<code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>,
then again with <code>useCapture</code> set to
<code>false</code>.
@param priority         The priority level of the event listener. The
priority is designated by a signed 32-bit integer.
The higher the number, the higher the priority.
All listeners with priority <i>n</i> are processed
before listeners of priority <i>n</i>-1. If two or
more listeners share the same priority, they are
processed in the order in which they were added.
The default priority is 0.
@param useWeakReference Determines whether the reference to the listener
is strong or weak. A strong reference(the
default) prevents your listener from being
garbage-collected. A weak reference does not.
*
<p>Class-level member functions are not subject to
garbage collection, so you can set
<code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code>
for class-level member functions without
subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set
<code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code>
for a listener that is a nested inner function,
the function will be garbage-collected and no
longer persistent. If you create references to the
inner function(save it in another variable) then
it is not garbage-collected and stays
persistent.</p>
